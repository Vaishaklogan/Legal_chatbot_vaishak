üß† Step-by-Step Process Explanation of the Legal Advice Chatbot (Using Python)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Importing Necessary Tools
The project starts by importing the necessary Python libraries ‚Äî mainly pandas, which is used for reading and handling data from a CSV file.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Loading the Dataset
A dataset (CSV file) that contains frequently asked legal questions and their corresponding answers is loaded into the program. This data is structured in two main columns: "Question" and "Answer".

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaning and Preprocessing the Data
Before comparing the data with user input, all the questions in the dataset are converted to lowercase. This step ensures that the comparison is not affected by uppercase or lowercase differences.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Accepting User Input
The chatbot then prompts the user to enter a legal question. This input is also converted to lowercase and broken down into individual words for easier comparison.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Keyword Matching Logic
The chatbot uses a basic keyword-based search logic. It goes through each question in the dataset and checks if any of the words from the user's input are present in the dataset‚Äôs questions.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Providing a Relevant Answer
If a match is found between the user‚Äôs question and any of the questions in the dataset, the chatbot displays the matched question along with the appropriate legal answer.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Unmatched Questions
If no relevant match is found, the chatbot informs the user and suggests rephrasing the question for better results.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Interaction
The program runs in a loop, allowing users to ask multiple questions until they choose to exit the chatbot.
